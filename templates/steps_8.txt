Q -> what i sget and post
GET and POST are two fundamental HTTP request methods used for communication between clients (e.g., browsers) and servers. Here's a breakdown of their differences, use cases, and how they work:

1. GET Request
Purpose: Retrieve data from a server (e.g., load a webpage, fetch search results).

Key Characteristics:

Parameters are sent in the URL (visible in the address bar).
Example: https://example.com/search?query=catboost

Limited data size (URL length restrictions, typically ~2048 characters).

Idempotent: Repeated requests do not change server state (safe for reloading).

Cached by browsers and servers (improves performance).

Not secure for sensitive data (parameters are exposed in URLs/logs).

When to Use:

Fetching data (e.g., search results, loading a webpage).

Bookmarkable links (since parameters are in the URL).

Safe operations that donâ€™t modify server data.

Example:

html
Copy
<!-- A simple GET form -->
<form action="/search" method="GET">
  <input type="text" name="query">
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
Run HTML
2. POST Request
Purpose: Submit data to a server (e.g., send form data, upload files).

Key Characteristics:

Data is sent in the request body (not visible in the URL).

No size limits (supports large files, e.g., images).

Non-idempotent: Repeated requests may change server state (e.g., placing multiple orders).

Not cached by default.

More secure for sensitive data (e.g., passwords, credit card info).

When to Use:

Submitting forms (e.g., login, registration, payment).

Uploading files.

Actions that modify server data (e.g., creating/deleting records).

Example:

html
Copy
<!-- A simple POST form -->
<form action="/login" method="POST">
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
